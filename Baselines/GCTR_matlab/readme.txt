I. Introduction

This code generate a point cloud.
Then it creates a duplicate of this cloud rotate it, scale it, and add some noise.
Then the algorithm matches the two point clouds.

II. How to use

1/ lunch install.m
2/ lunch demo.m

III. Errors

As the code has been recentely completely rewritten for matlab bugs might remain.
